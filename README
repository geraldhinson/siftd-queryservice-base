// TODOS:
// - JWT support
// - go through the code and see what isn't needed
// - add metrics for DB connections, etc.
// - ensure that we close the db connection when done and aren't leaking them
// - DONE - add support for other desired column types
// - Add in the health check route
// - Add in the public query store
// - new relic or similar
// - DONE understand interfaces and if needed
// - make sure not vulnerable to sql injection
// - deal with null supporting columns
// - DONE keep or nuke viper/config stuff
