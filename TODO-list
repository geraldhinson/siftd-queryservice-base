// TODOs:
// - CONSIDER: add metrics for DB connections, etc.?
// - CONSIDER: anything special to add for new relic or similar monitoring
// - add call to retrieve the list of queries OR alternatively, consider moving the queries defined into the resource store under known IDs (similar to journal reader and scheduler pattern)
// - unit/load testing similar to siftd-base
