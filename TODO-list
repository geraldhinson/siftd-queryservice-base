TODO-list:
 - CONSIDER: add metrics for DB connections, etc.?
 - CONSIDER: anything special to add for new relic or similar monitoring?
 - DONE: health check DB call is not working
 - DONE: clean up errors and logging like done for siftd-base 
 - DONE: add debug with env var like siftd-base has done
 - DONE (1/2): add call to retrieve the list of queries OR alternatively, consider moving the queries defined into the resource store under known IDs (similar to journal reader and scheduler pattern)
	- probably returning too much data in this - simplify it
 - DONE (mostly - better coverage desired): unit/load testing similar to siftd-base
